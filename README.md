# TicTacToe branch by Alfredo Barragan

THIS WAS DONE IN MACOS
This commit includes a working TicTacToe game with correct outputs however code redability is something I still need.

TODO LIST:

1.Program Builds Successfully (After all implementation is done)
    -DONE: Able to build and run with no errors after all required implementation.

2.Game works properly: allows interactive turn by turn play
    -DONE: Able to place pieces at all 9 possible places with a second player also (NOT AI as of current submission)

3.Game works properly: detects all win/draw conditions
    -Working property. 

    -NEED HELP WITH CODE REDABILITY ON THIS.

4.Game works properly: allows reset
    -DONE: Reset Game button erases all filled squares and allows to play another game.

5.Code readability
    -INCOMPLETE: Although I am happy with getting it to run there is definitely some stuff that I
    am unaware of that will help with readability.

6.Required comments describing implementation
    -DONE: added comments inside fuction and ontop of function describing how i implemented them
